# Rich-Neighborhood Contrastive Learning Framework for Drug Repositioning via Structural and Semantic Neighbor Fusion

This repository implements the Neural Collaborative Filtering (RCL-DR) model for predicting drug-disease associations. The model utilizes graph neural networks and contrastive learning to capture complex relationships between drugs and diseases.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.10+
- See `requirements.txt` for full dependencies

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ydxlj/RCL-DR.git
cd RCL-DR
pip install -r requirements.txt
